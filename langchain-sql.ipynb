    "# LangChain\n",
    "Here are a few patterns where LLMs can be augmented with other systems: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert natural language to SQL, run the SQL on a database, analyze and present the results\n",
    "* Call an external webhook or API based on the user query\n",
    "* Synthesize outputs from multiple models, or chain the models in a specific order\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/Patterns_augmenting_LLMs_with_external_systems.jpg \"Title\")\n",
    "\n",
    "It may look trivial to plumb these calls together and orchestrate them but it becomes a mundane task to write glue code again and again e.g. for every different data connector or a new model. That’s where LangChain comes in!\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain’s modular implementation of components and common patterns combining these components makes it easier to build complex applications based on language models. LangChain enables these models to connect to data sources and systems as agents to take action. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Components** are abstractions that work to bring external data, such as your documents, databases, applications,APIs to language models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents** enable language models to communicate with its environment, where the model then decides the next action to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain offers a variety of modules that can be used to create language model applications. These modules can be combined to create more complex applications, or can be used individually for simpler applications.\n",
    "![alt text](images/Figure-3-LangChain_Concepts.max-1300x1300.png \"Title\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Models** are the building block of LangChain providing an interface to different types of AI models. Large Language Models (LLMs), Chat and Text Embeddings models are supported model types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompts** refers to the input to the model, which is typically constructed from multiple components. LangChain provides interfaces to construct and work with prompts easily - Prompt Templates, Example Selectors and Output Parsers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory** provides a construct for storing and retrieving messages during a conversation which can be either short term or long term.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexes** help LLMs interact with documents by providing a way to structure them. LangChain provides Document Loaders to load documents, Text Splitters to split documents into smaller chunks, Vector Stores to store documents as embeddings, and Retrievers to fetch relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chains** let you combine modular components (or other chains) in a specific order to complete a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents** are a powerful construct in LangChain allowing LLMs to communicate with external systems via Tools and observe and decide on the best course of action to complete a given task.\n",
    "* Tools are functions that perform specific duties, such as Google Search, database lookups, or Python REPL. They take a string as input and return a string as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Agents are responsible for determining which actions to take and in what order. They can use tools, observe the output, or return to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Toolkits are collections of tools that can be utilized by agents. LangChain supports various toolkits to help developers create powerful applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Enterprise data is often stored in SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs make it possible to interact with SQL databases using natural langugae.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain offers SQL Chains and Agents to build and run SQL queries based on natural language prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are compatible with any SQL dialect supported by SQLAlchemy (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Databricks, SQLite).\n",
    "\n",
    "They enable use cases such as:\n",
    "* Generating queries that will be run based on natural language questions\n",
    "* Creating chatbots that can answer questions based on database data\n",
    "* Building custom dashboards based on insights a user wants to analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "LangChain provides tools to interact with SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build SQL queries based on natural language user questions\n",
    "2. Query a SQL database using chains for query creation and execution\n",
    "3. Interact with a SQL database using agents for robust and flexible querying\n",
