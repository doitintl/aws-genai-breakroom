    "## Tips to enhance your prompt-engineering abilities\n",
    "1. Know the modelâ€™s strengths and weaknesses\n",
    "    * It's recommended that a human is involved when the Codey APIs are used. Outputs of solutions created with the Codey APIs should be comprehensively tested before the solutions are used by customers in production.\n",
    "    * Code generated by the Codey APIs is not intended or designed to be a replacement for code development.\n",
    "    * We recommend that you don't use the Codey APIs to implement solutions for sensitive industries, such as cybersecurity and hacking prevention.\n",
    "2. Be as specific as possible\n",
    "    * If you know the specific tables or columns of interest, provide them as context.\n",
    "    * If there is unique business logic for your business (e.g. sales = units * price), provide this.\n",
    "    * Providing the SQL type and version is a best practice for returning the correct SQL syntax.\n",
    "3. Utilize contextual prompts\n",
    "    * Contextual prompts can include the specific task you want the model to perform and a replica of the output you're looking for.\n",
    "    * To minimize hallucinations, provide as much contextual information as reasonably possible, and if possible, use fine-tuning. \n",
    "4. Provide AI models with examples\n",
    "    * Provide a few question/answer examples so the model learns how to interact with the tables. Use the codechat-model to generate questions for you based on the schema.\n",
    "5. Experiment with prompts and personas\n",
    "    * Try experimenting with different sentence structures in the prompt. Organizing the prompt with the filtering, grouping, and aggregation components together could help improve query generation capabilities.\n",
    "6. Try chain-of-thought prompting\n",
    "    * Chain of thought prompting is a technique for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It works by breaking down a complex problem into smaller steps, and then prompting the LLM to provide intermediate reasoning for each step. This helps the LLM to understand the problem more deeply, and to generate more accurate and informative answers. This will help you to understand the answer better and to make sure that the LLM is actually understanding the problem."
